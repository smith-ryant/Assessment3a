        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Salutations! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ryan Smith, currently
          fulfilling the role of a Product Manager for a medical device company.
          But that's not all I aspire to be. Presently, I am exploring the field
          of software engineering with a learning endeavor at DevMountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in the scenic locale of Twin Falls, ID. Here, I am blessed with
          a lively and love-filled family, comprising my spouse, our lovely
          daughter, and our four quirky pets; two cats and two dogs. The result?
          There is never a dull moment in our household.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to personal interests, music holds a special place in my
          heart. Not only do I appreciate its soothing allure, but I am also an
          avid collector, trader, and seller of guitars, nurturing a small but
          cherished collection. To celebrate this passion, I am on a delightful
          journey, learning the chords of guitar and the tunes of piano.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for my career vision, it is a blend of professional growth and
          personal fulfillment. Envisaging a kind of progressive retirement, I
          aim to create software solutions for the company I am associated with
          while simultaneously building a client base in the capacity of a
          freelance Software Engineer.
